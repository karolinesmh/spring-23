Sometimes Jem and Momma Sherry are not on the same wavelength. Jem has the zoomies and wants to play while Momma Sherry wants to relax and take a moment to herself. However, to make sure Jem gets his energy out and has fun, these are Momma Sherry's favorite ways to keep Jem entertained!

<h2> 1. A Peanut Butter Kong

<h4> A Kong filled with frozen peanut butter gives Jem a tasty treat while using his mind and body to work for his reward! The kong keeps him busy long enough for Momma Sherry to read a few chapters from her book!

<h2> 2. Puzzle Food Bowl

<h4>  A puzzle food bowl allows Jem to work on his prey drive and hunting skills when eating his meals! It takes a bit longer for Jem to finish his food, allowing Momma Sherry to do the dishes.
