Hello friends, the past couple of weeks have been a lot! I had a follow up at the UW Veterinary Care a couple of weeks ago and had an ultrasound completed on my liver and gallbladder because my levels were off. We decided to start weaning me off prednisone because of all of my side effects.

Not long after, I went to my local vet. My hematocrit was lower so we planned on doing a transfusion the next day to get me through this process. However, I began vomiting and would not eat and was super lethargic. We headed to Madison for a transfusion which they did overnight.

I still was not my usual self, so another ultrasound was done and free fluid was found in my abdomen. It turned out to be bile from my gallbladder. Complications from the aspiration that was completed with the intial ultrasound. I needed to have emergency surgery to remove it.

I am home recovering from the surgery and am taking a new medications to help combat the Babesiosis! I will continue to keep you all updated.

Love,
Jem <3
