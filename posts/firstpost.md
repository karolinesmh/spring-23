Hi, my name is Jem and I am an American Pit Bull Terrier! I was born in Alabama with Angular Limb Deformity in my two front legs. I was found in a rural shelter by a volunteer for ABRA Angels who asked if they were willing to take me on and they said YES! I lived with the best fosters ever, Momma and Daddy J, and their mostly little foster to hospice dogs for a year while I went through several surgeries and Heartworm treatment.

While my sister, Kate, was working at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Veterinary Care, she met me and sent a video to mom. From that moment, mom knew I would be a part of their family. I now have another sister--Karoline, three doggy nieces--Penny, Chepa, and Daphne, and one doggy nephew--Gumball. I love my furever family!

As time progressed, I delevoped some new issues. Cultaneous Plasmacytosis--a type of skin cancer, Evan's Syndrome--a combination of IMHA (low red blood cells) and ITP (low platelets). We beleive it was caused by Babesiosis, which I was found to have. This is a common tick-borne ilness among pit bulls used as fighting dogs, which is where we think I came from, unfortunately.

I was born a fighter, but in the best way! I am strong and will keep trying to overcome my illnesses.

Love you all,
Jem <3
